household welfare
The household welfare is the material 
welfare of the representative household
in the economy. 

Generally an introduction of a tax 
decrease household welfare as the 
household allocates its resources to
maximize its material welfare. When
he is taxed, he can not alocate his
resources as freely, leading to an
inferior outcome.

However, we are not measuring direct
or indirect benefits of the decrease
in polution, so its possible that the
actual welfare increases.
