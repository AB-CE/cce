 Introduction
The following graphs show the production and prices 
for all sectors. For the primary sectors the embedded 
co2 in displayed. For the consumer it shows the 
welfare.


Secondary sectors don't produce co2 other than the co2, 
which is already accounted for in the primary sectors 
co2 output.

The first 50 periods of the simulation are not 
displayed as they serve to set up the model. At period 
100, the new policy is implemented. The user can 
observe the co2 output before and after the 
introduction of the new tax policy.
