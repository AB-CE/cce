Often right after the introduction of
a new tax regime the economy reacts 
very strong or with fluctuations. This
is a model limitation. In reality firms
and consumers have forsight, which gives
them the ability to smooth their 
production and consumption decisions.
The model agents don't have this ability
and therefore we see strong fluctuations.
